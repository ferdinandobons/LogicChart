# Changelog

All notable changes to LogicChart will be documented in this file.

The project follows Semantic Versioning once public releases begin.

## Unreleased

## 0.2.1

- Interactive viewer: drag any block to rearrange the flowchart by hand; connected edges
  re-route live, hand-placed positions persist per flow, and reset restores the auto layout.
- README rewritten for clarity: sharper scope, a runnable 30-second example, an outcome-
  focused "Why", a per-command reference with real output, explicit limitations, and the
  agent/MCP integrations moved to an "Advanced" section.

## 0.2.0

First tagged release. A deterministic, local, no-API-key static analyzer that turns
Python and TypeScript source into a versioned logical model plus reviewable
flowcharts, with evidence-tiered findings (`VERIFIED` / `INFERRED` / `POTENTIAL_GAP`).

### Analysis & IR

- Deterministic Python (AST) and TypeScript/TSX (tree-sitter) analyzers producing one
  canonical `logic-flow.json` model (schema 1.1).
- Framework adapters: FastAPI routes; Next.js route handlers, middleware, server
  actions, pages, and layouts; shallow React components, hooks, and event handlers;
  public/exported functions, CLI commands, and tests.
- IR enrichment: per-branch outcomes, decision identity (subject/operator/negation/
  value namespace), reachability, side-effect tags, declared enum/union value tables,
  module-level constants, and stable structural finding ids.
- Import-aware call resolver with `module:symbol` boundary preservation, longest-prefix
  module resolution, submodule-import binding, and per-call link confidence.

### Detectors (11, evidence-tiered)

- Single-flow: `missing_branch`, `dead_code`, `broad_except_swallow` (empty **or**
  log-only handlers), `no_op_branch`, `asymmetric_return`, `dead_guard`.
- Cross-flow: `inconsistent_case_handling` (quorum-aware), `enum_exhaustiveness`,
  `outcome_inconsistency` (HTTP status-aware), `logging_asymmetry`.
- Gated (opt-in via `gated_detectors`): `auth_divergence`.

### Surfaces

- CLI: `init`, `analyze` (`--full`, `--include-gaps`), `update`, `impact`, `query`,
  `view`, `install`, `hook` (install/uninstall/status), `mcp`, and `diff`.
- CI diff gate: `diff` compares two models by stable finding id and emits a GitHub
  Markdown summary and SARIF (stable `partialFingerprints`), with `--fail-on-introduced`.
- Markdown report with a signal/noise split - `VERIFIED`/`INFERRED` in the main
  section, `POTENTIAL_GAP` folded under a collapsible review-only block (`--include-gaps`
  to expand) - plus injection-safe escaping of source-derived finding text.
- Interactive local HTML viewer.
- MCP server with 11 tools and a `token_budget` cap on every query/list tool.
- Agent instruction installer (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, Cursor rules) and
  managed git auto-sync hooks with a `merge=union` driver for `logic-flow.json`.

### Robustness

- Incremental content-hash cache with per-file analysis.
- Per-file parse isolation: an un-parseable or non-UTF-8 file is skipped and reported
  in `skipped_files` rather than aborting the whole run.
- Malformed `logic-flow.json` is rejected with a clean error instead of a raw traceback.
